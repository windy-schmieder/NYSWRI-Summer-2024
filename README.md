# NYSWRI-Summer-2024
Projects that I worked on as part of the New York State Water Resources Institute during the summer of 2024. /

Both projects were a collaboration between Tomás Schmieder & Adrián Cardona Young and their mentors.

## Biotransformation of PFAS in Biosolids

"Final Literature Review.docx" is our file containing all the information that we compiled and some of our references (there is a giant zotero library that NYSWRI has with ALL of the references we looked at) on the current understanding and experimental method of studying the biotransformation of PFAS in biosolids. /

"Intern Report PFAS in biosolids.docx" is the NYS WRI intern report of what we did for this project over the course of the summer, basically a TLDR for the project.

"PFAS WRI Webinar.pptx" is the presentation file we presented at the end for the webinar.

## Phenological Calendar of the Hudson River Valley

"Phenological Calendar for Hudson River Valley - Adrian & Tomas.jpg" is the final product of this project.

"On display at the estuary reserve.jpg" is an image showing the poster on display at the Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HRNERR).
